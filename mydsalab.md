- This project is about building a reference for common datastructures and algorithms
- It is entirely written in Java
- Though it started by writing code and tests manually from scratch, Gemini is extensively used later
- The documentation is entirely developed using Gemini 
- It has mainly two packages
  - datastructures
  - algorithms
- The whole code is unit tested
- There is comprehensive documentation for each datastructure and algorithm
- Drill down to the packages to understand the code
- Refer README file for an overview of the project
