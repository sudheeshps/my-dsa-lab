# Bubble Sort

## History

Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that was first described by Iverson in 1962. It is often used as a teaching tool because of its straightforward implementation.

## Algorithm Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2) in the best, average, and worst cases.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)

## Comparison

Bubble Sort is one of the most inefficient sorting algorithms. It is significantly slower than more advanced algorithms like QuickSort, MergeSort, and HeapSort. However, it is very simple to understand and implement.

## Known Applications

Due to its poor performance, Bubble Sort is rarely used in practice. Its primary application is in educational settings to introduce the concept of sorting algorithms.

## API Documentation

### `public T[] sort()`

Sorts the array of elements in ascending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm.

- **Returns**: The sorted array of elements.
