# Heap Sort

## History

Heap Sort was invented by J. W. J. Williams in 1964. It is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses a binary heap data structure.

## Algorithm Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) in the best, average, and worst cases.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)

## Comparison

Heap Sort is a great general-purpose sorting algorithm. It has a guaranteed O(n log n) time complexity, but it is not a stable sort. It is often compared to QuickSort and MergeSort.

## Known Applications

Heap Sort is used in a variety of applications, including priority queues and in-place sorting. It is also used in the Linux kernel.

## API Documentation

### `public T[] sort()`

Sorts the array of elements in ascending order using the Heap Sort algorithm.

- **Returns**: The sorted array of elements.
