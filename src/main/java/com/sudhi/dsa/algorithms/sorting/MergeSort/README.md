# Merge Sort

## History

Merge Sort was invented by John von Neumann in 1945. It is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that is one of the most efficient sorting algorithms.

## Algorithm Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) in the best, average, and worst cases.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n)

## Comparison

Merge Sort is a very efficient sorting algorithm. It is a stable sort, which means that the relative order of equal elements is preserved. It is often compared to QuickSort and HeapSort.

## Known Applications

Merge Sort is used in a variety of applications, including external sorting and in-place sorting. It is also used in the Java standard library.

## API Documentation

### `public T[] sort()`

Sorts the array of elements in ascending order using the Merge Sort algorithm.

- **Returns**: The sorted array of elements.
