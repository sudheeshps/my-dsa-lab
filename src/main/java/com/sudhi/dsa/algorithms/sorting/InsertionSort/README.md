# Insertion Sort

## History

Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that was first described by Donald L. Shell in 1959. It is a simple and efficient sorting algorithm for small data sets.

## Algorithm Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n) in the best case, O(n^2) in the average and worst cases.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)

## Comparison

Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that is efficient for small data sets. It is not as efficient as more advanced algorithms like QuickSort, MergeSort, and HeapSort for large data sets.

## Known Applications

Insertion Sort is often used as a subroutine in more advanced sorting algorithms, such as ShellSort. It is also used to sort small data sets.

## API Documentation

### `public T[] sort()`

Sorts the array of elements in ascending order using the Insertion Sort algorithm.

- **Returns**: The sorted array of elements.
